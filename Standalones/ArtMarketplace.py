# Amazing! We built out a whole marketplace with buyers, sellers, art, and listings!

# Here are some more things you could try:

# Add a wallet instance variable to clients, update the buying and selling of artworks to also exchange dollar amounts.
# Create a wishlist for your clients, things that are listed but theyâ€™re not sure if they should purchase just yet.
# Create expiration dates for listings! Have out of date listings automatically removed from the marketplace.
